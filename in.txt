Autumn early morning It is cold mist rising from the forest floor sheathing the green bamboo trees
in the grove muffling sounds hiding the Twelve Peaks to the east The maple leaves on the way here 
are red and yellow on the ground
and falling The temple bells from the edge of town seem distant
when they ring as if from another world There are tigers in
the forest but they hunt at night will not be hungry now and
this is a small grove The villagers of Shengdu though they fear
them and the older ones make offerings to a tiger god at altars
still go into the woods by day when they need to for firewood or
to hunt unless a man eater is known to be about At such times a
primitive terror claims them all and fields will go untilled
tea plants unharvested until the beast is killed which can take
a great effort and sometimes there are deaths The boy was
alone in the bamboo grove on a morning swaddled in fog a wan
weak hint of sun pushing between leaves light trying to declare
itself not quite there He was swinging a bamboo sword hed made
and he was angry Hed been unhappy and aggrieved for two weeks
now having reasons entirely sufficient in his own mind such as
his life lying in ruins like a city sacked by barbarians
